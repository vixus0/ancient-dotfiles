dotfiles
========

My current configuration files organised per-application since I'm now using
GNU Stow to link them to their appropriate locations. I was thinking of using
other dotfile management systems such as dots or homeshick, but they seemed
like overkill when Stow is available in the repositories of most distros.

Using a package-like system means I only install config files for the packages
I need on each machine.
